# Adventure 1: Transport to Junderoth

The party are all found guilty of crimes in the Confederacy, irrespective of
whether or not they actually committed them.

They are sentenced to be transported to the prison colony of Junderoth, a
continent which appeared out of nowhere a few years ago over which every power
in Qor'thos has started to scamble.

They journey to Junderoth on a rickety ship, the _Duke of Esaerell_, meeting
each other for the first time as well as a their fellow transportees and guards.

At Port Walen, the Confederacy's humble outpost on Junderoth, they are assigned
to forest clearing duties to the north west of town.
