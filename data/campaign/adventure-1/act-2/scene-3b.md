# Scene 3b: Parley with the Grungs

If the party can figure out a way of communicating with the Grungs, they will
find out that the Grungs are are having their terrority encroached upon by the
Confederate expansion into the forest. They can offer to
[negotiate with the Governor of Port Walen](../act-3/scene-2b.md) to see if they
can shift the forest clearing operationsto somewhere else.
