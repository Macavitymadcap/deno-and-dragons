# Junderoth

A blend of the Americas and Polynesia. A huge landmass with expansive rain 
forests, mountains and coastlines with sister islands off to it's west and a
prismatic reef to it's east. 

## History

Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from scholars
cannot argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place is brimming
with magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled many sailors 
when they enocuntered it, and strange mirages visible over landmass have 
also been reported.

The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao followed by Käs. Both being
to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty Archipelago
and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The Jade throne has 
extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with their eyes on the wonders
and resources of the Sunspirer Mountains.

Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering Plains, 
establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the Thunderbird Nomads.
They have no great colonial ambition but are more interested in the resources, 
but their aggressive trade policies have made them enemies with the Sunspire 
Confederation.
