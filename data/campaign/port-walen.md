# Port Walen

##  Overview

Port Walen is a fledgling outpost on the coast of Junderoth, barely a few 
years old. It's a mix of hastily constructed buildings, tents, and some 
sturdier structures, sprawling from a natural cove inland. The town is 
surrounded by a wooden palisade, constantly being expanded as the 
settlement grows.
