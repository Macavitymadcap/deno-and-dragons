  <h1>An Overview of Junderoth</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from scholars
      argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place is brimming with
      magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled many sailors when
      they enocuntered it, and a strange white cloud of mirages visible over the
      landmass havevalso been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao, followed by Käs. Both
      being to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty
      Archipelago and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The
      Jade Throne has extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with their
      eyes on the wonders and resources of the Sunspire Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering
      Plains, establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the
      Thunderbird Nomads. They have no great colonial ambition, being more
      interested in the acquisition and trade of resources. While their aggressive
      trade policies have made them enemies with the Sunspire Confederation.
