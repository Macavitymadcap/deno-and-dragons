  <h1>An Overview of Junderoth</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from
      scholars argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place is
      brimming with magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled
      many sailors when they enocuntered it, and a strange white cloud of
      mirages visible over the landmass havevalso been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao, followed by Käs. Both
      being to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty
      Archipelago and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The
      Jade Throne has extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with
      their eyes on the wonders and resources of the Sunspire Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering
      Plains, establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the
      Thunderbird Nomads. They have no great colonial ambition, being more
      interested in the acquisition and trade of resources. While their
      aggressive trade policies have made them enemies with the Sunspire
      Confederation.

        <p>
          Port Walen is a fledgling outpost on the coast of Junderoth, barely a
          few years old. It's a mix of hastily constructed buildings, tents, and
          some sturdier structures, sprawling from a natural cove inland. The
          town is surrounded by a wooden palisade, constantly being expanded as
          the settlement grows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air in Port Walen is thick with anticipation and tension. The
          smell of salt water mixes with the earthy scent of the nearby forest.
          The constant sound of construction and the shouts of workers and
          guards create a bustling atmosphere. Despite attempts at order,
          there's an underlying sense of lawlessness and opportunity that
          permeates the settlement.
