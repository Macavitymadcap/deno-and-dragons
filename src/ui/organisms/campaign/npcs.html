      <p>
        Elara's keen eye for detail and strong sense of duty were noted by her
        superiors in Grisellden years ago. When it came to decide who should run
        the Confederacy's outpost on Junderoth, she was the obvious choice. She
        is determined to make Port Walen a success, no matter the cost.

        business grants for those willing to brave Junderoth, he decided to have
        one last adventure: running a tavern.
