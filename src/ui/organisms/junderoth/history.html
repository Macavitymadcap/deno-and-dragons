  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from scholars
    cannot argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place is brimming
    with magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled many sailors
    when they enocuntered it, and strange mirages visible over landmass have
    also been reported.

    The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao followed by Käs. Both
    being to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty
    Archipelago and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The
    Jade throne has extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with their
    eyes on the wonders and resources of the Sunspirer Mountains.

    Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering
    Plains, establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the
    Thunderbird Nomads. They have no great colonial ambition but are more
    interested in the resources, but their aggressive trade policies have made
    them enemies with the Sunspire Confederation.
