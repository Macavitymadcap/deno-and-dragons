  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from scholars
    argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place is brimming with
    magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled many sailors when
    they enocuntered it, and a strange white cloud of mirages visible over the
    landmass havevalso been reported.

    The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao, followed by Käs. Both
    being to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty
    Archipelago and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The
    Jade Throne has extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with their
    eyes on the wonders and resources of the Sunspire Mountains.

    Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering
    Plains, establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the
    Thunderbird Nomads. They have no great colonial ambition, being more
    interested in the acquisition and trade of resources. While their aggressive
    trade policies have made them enemies with the Sunspire Confederation.
