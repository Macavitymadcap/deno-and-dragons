                Elara's keen eye for detail and strong sense of duty were noted by her superiors
                in Grisellden years ago. When it came to decide who should run the Confederacy's
                outpost on Junderoth, she was the obvious choice. She is determined to make Port
                Walen a success, no matter the cost.
