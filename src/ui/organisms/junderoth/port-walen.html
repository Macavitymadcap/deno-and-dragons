  <h2>Port Walen</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Port Walen is a fledgling outpost on the coast of Junderoth, barely a few
    years old. It's a mix of hastily constructed buildings, tents, and some
    sturdier structures, sprawling from a natural cove inland. The town is
    surrounded by a wooden palisade, constantly being expanded as the settlement
    grows.
  </p>
  <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
  <p>
    The air in Port Walen is thick with anticipation and tension. The smell of
    salt water mixes with the earthy scent of the nearby forest. The constant
    sound of construction and the shouts of workers and guards create a bustling
    atmosphere. Despite attempts at order, there's an underlying sense of
    lawlessness and opportunity that permeates the settlement.
