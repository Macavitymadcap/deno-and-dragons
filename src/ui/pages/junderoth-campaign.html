  <h1>Junderoth</h1>
  <p>
    A blend of the Americas and Polynesia. A huge landmass with expansive rain
    forests, mountains and coastlines with sister islands off to it's west and a
    prismatic reef to it's east.
  </p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Colonial History</summary>
    <p>
      Junderoth appeared on Qor'thos only 2 years ago. Where it came from
      scholars cannot argue over, but what they do agree upon is that the place
      is brimming with magic. The Prismatic Reef on it's eastern side bedazzled
      many sailors when they enocuntered it, and strange mirages visible over
      landmass have also been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first nation to take an interest was Bay-Tsao followed by Käs. Both
      being to the west of Junderoth they managed to easily navigate the Misty
      Archipelago and establish trade routes with the Tideweaver Islanders. The
      Jade throne has extended it's reach by pushing into the interior with
      their eyes on the wonders and resources of the Sunspirer Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Käs has been more interested in the Obsidian Valleys and the Thundering
      Plains, establishing trade routes with the Obsidian League and the
      Thunderbird Nomads. They have no great colonial ambition but are more
      interested in the resources, but their aggressive trade policies have made
      them enemies with the Sunspire Confederation.
